Mingine is a toy game engine designed to work out-of-the-box with Visual Studio 2017. It is a very simple asset manager + SDL2 + lua. 
It is intended to be a small code base that students can use as a starting point for game engine development.

To learn how to make your own games with Mingine, read the MingineAPI.txt document in the same folder as this file.
